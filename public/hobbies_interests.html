<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
<p>
  I have a passion for watching football, the gym and keeping active. I have completed 5 Wolf Runs which goes hand in hand with enjoyment I find in running.

  In my spare time, fitted around my work and being at home, I am looking at trying to further my knowledge by taking courses. Alongside working in IT, I also find enjoyment from gaming.

  I have recently been fortunate enough to travel to New Zealand while continuing to do my job day to day, allowing me to experience and live in different cultures while continuing to work remotely.
